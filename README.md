# TRISTAN
This code will control the linear actuators on board the first iteration of the TRISTAN payload.


Changelog:

Version as of 2025/03/27 11:00 PM - First commit, containing code that was able to extend/retract the actuators based at a fixed interval, and could measure but not react to external inputs.
Version as of 2025/03/28 10:00 PM - Implemented ability to trigger the actuators based on external wired input using AA batteries (with noise resistance). Still need to test with the fluctus.
